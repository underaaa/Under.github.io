                <h2>I build myself a temp nas</h2>
                <p>This nas is only temp for now tell I get new hardware for a proper setup. I wanted to build this NAS. I'm using it now because I had a 2TB NVME laying around and this was a way I could use it better than just using it as a linux drive for my laptop.</p>
                <h2>The setup of this NAS</h2>
                <p>The start of building out my nas was first going to be a lenovo SFF PC that was just chilling in my closet. The problem that came from that was that the ram or the stability was making the ZFS Health just have lots of errors. So I just went to use my lenovo t14 gen 1 that I was not using for the time frame.</p>
                <h2>What am I using on this NAS</h2>
                <p>The apps are crafty, dockage, tailscale, jellyfin, immich, and navidrome for music. I’m also using it to have a personal smb share for files that I can back up easily and get a backup of things I used to keep on usb’s. With jellyfin my household uses it and I use my dvd ripping setup to get movies we own on it. I hope to get a blu-ray ripper so I can get our blurays saved too.</p>
                <h2>What is the plan for the system to replace it when I do that?</h2>
                <p>I want to get a headless booting motherboard with a ryzen cpu with at least 32gb of ram. For storage I want to get a case that has hot swapping and be able to get redundancy. I would also like to get an arc card or a nVidia card for transcoding.</p>
                <h2>I want to make this NAS have a stable network when leaving the house network.</h2>
                <p>For now I have my NAS be connected to a switch that connects to the main router with a basic wireless bridge. This is not the best setup but it works for now but when I get to it I want to get the wired setup and have its own switch to have my PC’s connect to it without stressing the main router. </p>

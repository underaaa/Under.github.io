                <h2>Who am I</h2>
                <p> I’m 19 and have been into tech for 4-6 years, I got into tech when my laptop broke 
                    and learned through videos about computers. I got a lot of support in my learning 
                    and have become good at troubleshooting PC’s and became an enjoyed hoppy. 
                    I am still in school and want to take it further to build a career in tech. 
                    I talk about politics at times but I’m not 100% right and try to understand 
                    every point of view so I can be informed. I also have been trying soldering 
                    to get better PC mods and learning hardware repair.

            <h3>Plans for the website</h3>
            <p>I plan to publish a few blogs each month and add new features that I’ve tested out.</p>
                <hr style="border: none; height: 24px; background: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <p>I’d like visitors to have ways to contact me and see what services I offer, such as repair work or other projects, but I might limit in‑person help to my city.</p>
                <hr style="border: none; height: 24px; background: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <p>I’m also going to redo the UI so the site looks nicer.</p>
            <h3>For tech learning</h3>
            <p>I want to keep advancing my skills every day and make progress that brings me closer to the career I want.</p>
            <h3>Random things I’m doing (and plan to talk about)</h3>
            <p>Using a Chromebook as my main laptop, I’m trying to use it every day.</p>
                <hr style="border: none; height: 24px; background: none; margin: 0; padding: 0;">
            <p>While doing that, I’ll manage the NAS I set up and create a better setup with a budget under $500 that matches the laptop’s performance.</p>
            <h3>AI stuff</h3>
            <p>I use an AI bot to rewrite my writing so it’s more grammatically correct. As of today I’m using OpenAI GPT‑OSS 20B. Many people dislike AI, but I prefer a local LLM that keeps my data private and helps me re-write because of my dyslexia.</p>

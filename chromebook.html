                <h1>Testing Out My First Chromebook</h1>

                <p>I recently snagged my very first personal Chromebook, an unexpected gift from my mom’s cleaning job that almost ended up in the landfill. I'm not going to lie, the whole “just a random piece of tech” vibe made me skeptical at first, but this little device has already won me over.</p>

                <h2>First Impressions</h2>
                <h3>Factory reset? Easy peasy.</h3>
                <p>The machine was still tied to someone’s Google account, but a quick search and a few clicks had it wiped clean in no time. That means I could start fresh right away, no legacy junk or hidden bloatware to deal with.</p>

                <h2>Setup speed</h2>
                <p>Setting up the Chromebook itself was a breeze. I used my Pixel phone for most of the configuration, which meant everything synced automatically and I could get straight to work.</p>

                <h3>Fast launch vs. Windows</h3>
                <p>If you’re tired of waiting for an OS to boot, this is your ticket. Chrome OS powers on in seconds and is ready to go before you even have time to make coffee. Compared with a typical Windows machine that can take minutes just to load the desktop, it’s a huge win.</p>

                <h2>Performance</h2>
                <p>The laptop runs an Intel N4020, a two‑core CPU that isn’t particularly fast. It slows down noticeably when downloading or during initial setup. With 4 GB of RAM, it’s adequate for light web and cloud work.</p>

                <h2>Cool Things I’ve Learned While Using It</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Networking - Phone data via tethering</li>
                    <li>Pixel integration - Apps open seamlessly between the Pixel and Chromebook.</li>
                    <li>Android features - Google Quick Pair, Cast, etc.</li>
                    <li>Built‑in AI - easy to use</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Things I Dislike (But Mostly Because of How I Use Tech)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lockdown and restrictions - Chrome OS is a bit closed off; you’re limited to the Google ecosystem.</li>
                    <li>Linux app compatibility - Some tools that run on Linux don’t work under the “Crostini” container, which can be frustrating if you need niche software.</li>
                    <li>Hardware lag - On older or very basic models, certain tasks feel slower than on a comparable Windows laptop.</li>
                    <li>Keyboard feel - The keyboard is decent but not as satisfying as my usual mechanical setup.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Will I Keep Using It?</h2>
                <p>Yes, and the long answer is very much so, with a few caveats:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Doc writing & web work - Ideal for drafting notes or editing DOCS while on the move.</li>
                    <li>Remote server management - With Tailscale set up, I can use my truenas server while I’m not home and get my music or watch movies on jellyfin.</li>
                    <li>Car rides - Its battery life is great; a full charge keeps me powered through long drives out of town and back without losing much juice.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So while it may not replace my main workstation, it’s become a reliable sidekick for tasks that don’t require heavy processing power.</p>

                <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>What started as a random find turned into a surprisingly useful tool. The Chromebook isn’t being too slow, integration with my Pixel, and the convenience of AI features make it a solid choice for anyone who needs a lightweight, always‑on device. Sure, there are limitations - especially if you’re a Linux power user - but for everyday productivity, remote access, and those long road trips, this little Chrome OS machine is doing wonders.</p>

                <p>If you’re thinking about dipping your toes into the Chromebook world (or just looking for a backup device), give one a try - you might be surprised at how well it fits into your tech life.</p>

                <h2>Who am I</h2>
                <p> I’m 19 and have been into tech for 4-6 years, I got into tech when my laptop broke 
                    and learned through videos about computers. I got a lot of support in my learning 
                    and have become good at troubleshooting PC’s and became an enjoyed hoppy. 
                    I am still in school and want to take it further to build a career in tech. 
                    I talk about politics at times but I’m not 100% right and try to understand 
                    every point of view so I can be informed. I also have been trying soldering 
                    to get better PC mods and learning hardware repair.

                <p>
                    Hi my name is jacob smith/Underlife__ I am a tech hobbyist and try to learn everything 
                    I can. This site was used to learn web development after trying it a few times. I also 
                    plan to take a CS30 class before I go to college and pick out a few options that my 
                    school gives for tech nerds/geeks. This site will be on GitHub and will try to do 
                    some stuff in javascript and make some stories on me so you can get to know a little 
                    about me.
                </p>

                <h2>What do I plan to do if tech doesn’t come out to be a job</h2>
                <p>
                    For me, tech is my main goal but I do plan to get into Trades
                    work as a backup. I have a liking for hands-on work like woodworking and 
                    trade jobs since they are mentally healthy for someone like me. I do plan to build 
                    out both careers if I can, and try to volunteer for both types of jobs so I don’t end up with 
                    no job when I'm older.
                </p>

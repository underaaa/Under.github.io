                Navigating My Adulthood: Reflections and Goals After Graduation
            </h2>
            <h3>The Transition: From Academia to the Real World</h3>
            <p>Graduating in 2025 felt like a significant milestone, bringing with it a new set of responsibilities. With school now behind me, my ability to dedicate time to personal projects has been opened up while I look for a job. While I had Goals for further education, the uncertainty surrounding a tuition-free option means my immediate focus is getting a job.
            Finding a position that supports my current lifestyle is key. This has also sparked serious consideration about moving out. My family's plans to move out after my younger brother finishes middle school mean that staying put isn't a viable option for me long-term. However, this push towards independence is motivating me to be proactive in my job search. Ideally, with sufficient income, I could potentially take over the lease for the house I’ve called home for seven years. This would be an ideal outcome – maintaining a familiar environment while enjoying the benefits of not having to pay utilities and having ample space to share with my boyfriend.
            </p>
            <h3>The Job Hunt: How I Will Attempt To Get A Job
            </h3>
            <p>Currently, I'm applying for jobs, aiming to submit one or two resumes daily to maintain momentum. If I haven’t secured any leads within a month, I plan to take a more direct approach by printing out resumes and visiting workplaces to request in-person interviews. Alongside the job search, I've also dedicated time to revamping this website project. My goal is to build a set of templates that will streamline future writing and updates while I have less time because of a job.</p>
            <h3>Renting Out A House and Securing the Future
            </h3>
            <p>Beyond securing employment, I’ve been actively focused on maintaining and improving our home. Having always taken pride in keeping things tidy, I've intensified my efforts since graduation. This includes tackling yard work, deep cleaning, and addressing general repairs to ensure the house remains fresh and comfortable. A notable achievement has been installing three air conditioners to prepare for the expected summer heat, which could exceed 30°C again this year. These have proven effective, especially during my various backyard projects. I even managed to revive a broken AC unit by cleaning it – a simple fix that saved me from potential discomfort.</p>
